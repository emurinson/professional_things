**Course narrative + some notes**
I first met Ethan when he enrolled in my new undergrad course "Tools for Writing a Research Paper in Economics" in 2023.  It was a small, upper-level course with only 8 students in it, which gave me an opportunity to get to know the students.  Ethan was enthusiastic from the beginning.  During the first few weeks of class each student was required to choose a topic for their paper and to construct a literature map of the relevant academic research. Ethan chose to research the relationship between multiple measures of consumer sentiment and various indicators of political party in power in the U.S. He consistently came to class well-prepared with questions and eager to learn more and build connections within the material. Over the semester, he utilized literature review and citation tools like Litmaps and Paperpile along with outside research to compile an introduction and literature review on the intersection between consumer sentiment and rationality. In completing his own empirical data work, he compiled and normalized data from the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers as well as data on U.S. electoral history, and utilizing Python, performed OLE regressions to quantify a relationship between the two data sets. To achieve this and then to create accompanying data visualizations, he familiarized himself with Python tools such as Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. At the culmination of the course, Ethan created an HTML presentation to present his findings to the class. 
-	After the course, was motivated to hammer home the tools he learned…took the initiative to ake online Unix course and Python for data science courses 
-	Impressed by his social ability and consistency, so brought him on as my undergraduate TA for my course
-	He’s proven adept at taking initiative in preparing for classes and corresponding with students
-	Shown skill in leading the class by teaching students and leading class instruction when needed
-	Also, advising him on his senior thesis which integrates what he learned in my class with the Econometric methods he’s learned in Econometrics
-	Thesis will investigate the relationship between income growth and measures of subjective well-being, by integrating a habit forming consumer into his modeling
**Highlights**
-	Last year as part of Professor Carroll’s Tools for Writing a Research Paper in Economics class, completed microeconomic research that analyzed the relationship between measures of consumer sentiment to the US political party in power.
-	This year in senior thesis, implementing econometric methods learned in the Econometrics course like panel data regression in my senior thesis that applies a single consumer habit formation model to measure the relationship between income growth and measures of subjective wellbeing.
-	Both experiences equipped me with skills in conducting literature reviews, data normalization, formatting, and analysis, and Python tools like Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
